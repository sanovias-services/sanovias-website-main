# Medical Experts Section Implementation

## Project Overview
- **Date**: September 25, 2025
- **Branch**: 6-add-medical-experts-profiles
- **Objective**: Add interactive partner doctors section to enhance credibility and user engagement

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Partner Logo Consistency
- **Issue**: Sindbad partner logo had inconsistent styling compared to other partners
- **Solution**: Applied white background (`bg-white`) to match Allianz and Uniqa logos
- **Files Modified**: `/src/app/(public)/page.tsx`
- **Technical Details**: Ensured consistent partner slider presentation with uniform logo backgrounds

### 2. Service Icons Visibility Enhancement
- **Issue**: Service icons in About page appeared as circles due to color palette changes
- **Solution**: Applied lighter background colors with proper opacity for better visibility
- **Files Modified**: `/src/app/(public)/about/page.tsx`
- **Color Implementation**:
  - Fast Appointments: `bg-[#2CA6A4]/10` (turquoise with 10% opacity)
  - Accredited Clinics: `bg-[#C9A66B]/10` (gold with 10% opacity)  
  - All-Inclusive Packages: `bg-[#2CA6A4]/10` (turquoise instead of gold per user preference)

### 3. Interactive Medical Experts Slider
